Basically what I am saying is if the bot kept track of a mission session, kept track
and announced each turn with ?rp turn then we could use that mission container for a series of things
including expending consumables.  There is only one consumable slot.  It is the grenade icon on the character sheet.
But instead of having a bunch of different commands that people would need to memorize,
we could use ?rp use1 for light weapon, ?rp use4 for melee, and rp use5 for consumable.
It might make it easier.
On top of that we could also have ?rp utility1 - 6 to use the utilities.
Utilities and weapons are supposed to degrade with use during a mission.
Utility degradation is simulated by static RNG currently.
(10% chance of failure) which means there is a chance something will fail the first time.
Want to replace that with a new system that is more predictable and also gives functionality
to the Auto Field Maintenance Unit ?rp afmu which repairs everything but itself, also subject to degradation.




BOT RP
**-RP is managed by a mission container which is created at the start of a mission using ?rp start
which initiates the storing of information related to RP.  Once a mission starts each turn can be tracked with ?rp turn.

-RP turns are treated as a measurement of time and also communicated to the players with a response
saying what Turn it currently is.  The turn number counts up with each ?rp turn command.  Players are allowed one action during each turn.

**-Rp mission container is terminated with ?rp end which ends the mission and resets all statistics.

**-The bot will need a player database that gets updated when a player links their Discord account to the website.

-Actions are performed with ?rp use1 - 6.  These represent the six slots on the top bar of a Equipment Sheet.
Slots 1-3 are guns, slot 4 is melee, slot 5 is defense, and slot 6 is consumable.

-Utilities can be triggered using ?rp utility1 - 6 in addition to how they already function.
These are the 6 utility slots that can be used.

-Utilities can degrade with each use.  If you use chaff every turn it may add 3% chance of failure each time.
This would replace the static 10% chance of failure we currently have.

-Auto Field Maintenance Unit is a utility that is supposed to reset degradation on all items but itself.
This would now be possible if the bot can store information in a database.

-Consumable slot ?rp use6 can only be used once per person during a mission.

-Reputation/Diamonds can be earned with some successful actions such as a hack.
